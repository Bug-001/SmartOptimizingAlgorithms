# SmartOptimizingAlgorithms
A repo of smart optimizing algorithms.

## Requirements
If you use anaconda or miniconda then you can just **ignore** this.
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- tqdm

**Finished algorithms are listed as below:**
- Genetic algorithm
- Simulated annealing algorithm
- Particle swarm optimization(excellent performance!)

The repo will keep updating as I'm learning new algs.
